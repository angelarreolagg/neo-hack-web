# PostHog post-wizard report

The wizard has completed a deep integration of PostHog analytics into the NeoHack developer events web app (Next.js 16.1.6, App Router). The following changes were made:

- **`instrumentation-client.ts`** (new): Initializes `posthog-js` client-side using the Next.js 15.3+ instrumentation pattern. Enables exception capture and debug mode in development.
- **`next.config.ts`** (updated): Added PostHog reverse-proxy rewrites (`/ingest/*` → PostHog US ingestion) and `skipTrailingSlashRedirect: true` to correctly handle PostHog API requests and avoid ad-blockers.
- **`components/ExploreBtn.tsx`** (updated): Added `posthog.capture('explore_events_clicked')` inside the existing `onClick` handler.
- **`components/EventCard.tsx`** (updated): Added `"use client"` directive and `posthog.capture('event_card_clicked', { event_title, event_slug, event_location, event_date })` on the `Link` click handler to track which events users click on.
- **`.env.local`** (new): Created with `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_PROJECT_TOKEN` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST`.
- **`posthog-js`**: Installed as a dependency.

| Event | Description | File |
|---|---|---|
| `explore_events_clicked` | User clicks the 'Explore Events' CTA button on the homepage hero section | `components/ExploreBtn.tsx` |
| `event_card_clicked` | User clicks on an event card to view event details; properties: `event_title`, `event_slug`, `event_location`, `event_date` | `components/EventCard.tsx` |

## Next steps

We've built some insights and a dashboard for you to keep an eye on user behavior, based on the events we just instrumented:

- **Dashboard**: [Analytics basics](https://us.posthog.com/project/379910/dashboard/1460211)
- **Insight**: [Explore Events clicks over time](https://us.posthog.com/project/379910/insights/ZOkILvqN) — daily trend of homepage CTA clicks
- **Insight**: [Event card clicks over time](https://us.posthog.com/project/379910/insights/bi9XvYHM) — daily trend of event card clicks
- **Insight**: [Top clicked events](https://us.posthog.com/project/379910/insights/fzorFJaI) — bar chart breaking down clicks by event title
- **Insight**: [Explore → Event card conversion funnel](https://us.posthog.com/project/379910/insights/vBU5Vday) — conversion funnel from hero CTA to event card click
- **Insight**: [Weekly unique users by interaction type](https://us.posthog.com/project/379910/insights/uaP27vDC) — weekly active users split by interaction type

### Agent skill

We've left an agent skill folder in your project. You can use this context for further agent development when using Claude Code. This will help ensure the model provides the most up-to-date approaches for integrating PostHog.
